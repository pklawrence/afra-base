                In today's fast-paced digital world, a slow website is a conversion killer. Users expect 
                instant gratification, and if your site takes too long to load, they'll likely hit the back 
                button and find a faster alternative. This isn't just about user experience; search engines 
                like Google also favor fast-loading websites, impacting your search rankings.

                Optimize Images:

            <div>
                <ol className="list-decimal ">
                    <li>
                        Images often make up the largest portion of a web page's size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compress images: Use tools to reduce file size without significant loss in quality (e.g., TinyPNG, Compressor.io).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose the right format: Use JPEGs for photographs, PNGs for images with transparency, and SVGs for vector graphics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Implement lazy loading: Load images only when they are about to appear in the user's viewport.
